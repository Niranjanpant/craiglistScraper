Who We Are
theCoderSchool is an after-school drop-off program for students ages 7 to 18 learning to code. We are the #1 after-school coding program in Silicon Valley with 50+ locations nationwide and growing. Our mission is to get kids coding, which instills a life-long confidence in technology and serves as an incredibly useful, creative skill.

sanramon.thecoderschool.com
Job Summary
theCoderSchool is looking for a passionate General Manager (GM) to grow our school to new heights! You will be the captain of your own ship and get the opportunity to:
  
    Grow a coding community of kids!
    Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the area.
    Meet and communicate with school teachers, PTA parents, and local businesses to create opportunities for kids to code.
    Be a part of and learn from a passionate team of 5 GMs (We are a franchisee of the greater organization; 2 of our 5 are top 2 in the nation) fueled by our mission to get more kids to code! 
  
  This is a full-time position. A typical school's open hours are weekdays 3:30-7:30pm and Saturdays 10am-3pm, but GMs work outside of these hours regularly. Our top GM’s labor of love keeps them busy throughout the week and they earn six figures from salary and profit share.

Responsibilities
The GM is the person in charge of the day-to-day operations and growing the school. The key responsibilities are to:
  
   Ensure students are having an engaging and productive learning experience.   
  Make families happy (via smooth operations: scheduling, customer service, staffing, etc.).   
  Grow the community (via Sales & Marketing activities and team culture).
  

Requirements
Candidates must be:
  
    Excited about coding for kids. You genuinely believe in our mission to get kids coding and have an easy time inspiring others to join the cause. Coding has impacted your life in a big way and you want to pay it forward to the next generation.
    Organized techie.  You have a natural sense of orderliness/organization and have a comfort of multitasking across multiple web applications (keep track of a complex schedule for hundreds of students, HR, events, sales & marketing processes using a myriad of web applications). You don’t need to know how to code but the idea of adopting new programs and platforms to streamline your work piques your curiosity.
    Driven.  You are excited by growing a business and are constantly figuring out ways to bring in new students.
    Decisive. You are comfortable making quick, logical decisions under pressure while balancing a variety of priorities.
    Great with people, especially kids. We are a people-centric business from managing our young adult coaches to establishing relationships with parents and members of your community.
  

Nice to have
Great candidates may also be:

  Experienced in CS & education. We can train you on how to hire and manage your technical coaches if you are not technical, but a technical and education (tutoring or the like) background to support the students learning experiences and even coach students several hours per week may be helpful.
A community ring-leader. You love to bring people together by organizing activities and events. This is a coding community where we can create new camps, hack-a-thons, workshops, game nights etc to expand the school’s presence in the community.

  Naturally inclined to outreach. The best GMs are natural advocates for our mission and thrive on outreach and community building. Sky is the limit with revenue sharing if you are organized and you like to grow.

Sound like a fun challenge?  Shoot us an email with a cover letter and resume!

Description:
This is a unique opportunity to work on a product that is transforming how professionals and individuals access and manage research articles. This position is perfect for someone who has an entrepreneurial spirit, likes tackling challenging problems, and enjoys having considerable autonomy on projects.

DeepDyve created a “Netflix for research” subscription service to revolutionize the $10B scientific and professional research industry.  Our initial users were scientists and researchers in small/mid-size businesses such as biopharma companies, high tech/clean tech startups, medical device co’s and non-profit organizations who desperately need authoritative research papers but lack the resources to pay for expensive journal subscriptions.  DeepDyve has partnered with over 150 leading academic publishers and aggregated over 20 million articles into a database subscription service where users have unlimited, read-only access (but not download and ‘own’) for a flat monthly/annual fee.  

More recently, DeepDyve has begun signing up small/medium businesses who license DeepDyve for their researchers.  For corporate clients, the need is for an affordable digital library platform (or as some have referred to us, as a ‘Salesforce for research’) that enables researchers to discover, access, manage and share their literature projects – all from one place.

In supporting this new corporate client base, DeepDyve has built out its rental database into this digital library platform to enable search, access, collaboration, organization, storage and integration with other literature and enterprise tools, such as Slack.

In close coordination with our business and engineering teams, you will help design and develop various features and capabilities that directly impact both our individual users and corporate clients. While you will have tremendous responsibility, we will also provide hands-on mentoring and support to provide the best opportunity for your growth and success.

Primary Responsibilities
Gather and organize design requirements for new products and features. Hear from all relevant parties.
Brainstorm and plan out the backend code as well as think through interactions with the front-end and ops infrastructure
Create prototypes and solicit feedback from colleagues and iterate as necessary.
Write all necessary backend code for new products and features using PHP and Java. You’ll work closely with front-end engineers to pass them all the required data.
Propose new product/feature ideas to improve the product and performance for both internal and external users

Requirements and Preferred Qualifications
5+ yrs experience coding backend logic for web apps. Fewer than 5 years is ok if previous work is highly relevant and of excellent quality.
Very strong attention to detail and thoroughness of work, including beyond the spec.
Excellent design sense - in terms of both codebase AND feature usability.
Excellent communication skills both written and verbal. Able to effectively communicate conceptual ideas and design rationale.
Ability to work independently and collaboratively.

Who We Are 

theCoderSchool San Jose is an after-school drop-off program for kids learning to code. The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let's get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World. 

Job Summary 

theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code - and how to think like a coder - and be rewarded with an amazing experience. This is a part-time position for 2-15 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule. Our open hours are 3-8pm Monday-Thursday and 9am-3pm on weekends. 

Responsibilities 

A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have two basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire. 
1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-on-one or one-on-two coding lessons for kids. Typically in Scratch or Snap for younger kids, and Python, Javascript/HTML and beyond for older kids. Specialty programming like Unity or Swift are helfip as well. 
2. Code Class. Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio.

This position rocks because you will: 
* Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to be our next generation of coders! 
* Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Bay Area. 
* Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology 


Requirements 
What do we want from you? Read on. 
* PASSION. All caps! This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge. 
* Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids! 
* Street Cred. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience. 
* Coding Skills. Strong grasp of general technologies, proficient coder and uber-logical thinker. General knowledge of popular languages with hands on skills in a few is required - Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS, Java, C++ are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront. 
* Experience teaching kids in Scratch/Snap or other languages is a plus

Sound awesome? Send an email with your resume to sanjose@thecoderschool.com.
